## About this release

This release provides two improvements over the existing CPTextField:

1. A cleaner, bolder, pixel perfect focus ring. The existing CPTextField artwork actually shrinks the border when the field is focused. The new artwork is stable.

2. Better insets to provide a more balanced placement of text within the field, and provide more consistent insets between nib2cib-created and code-created fields.
